# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and reports for the mini-projects done in McGill University's Applied Machine Learning course in Winter 2020.

## Project 1
The given task was to implement 2 classification models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in order to classify targets from 4 datasets acquired from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). We conducted several experiments, such as testing differing learning rates for each model, and measuring the models' corresponding accuracies as a function of the size of the training size. 

A subsequent [report](project1/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.

## Project 2
The given task was to investigate 5 classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, and Random Forest. The 5 models were trained on two datasets: [20 newsgroup](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html?highlight=newsgroup#sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups) and [IMDB Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). We performed hyperparameter tuning using randomized search with cross validation to achieve the best possible performance for each model. 

A subsequent [report](project2/writeup.pdf) was written to indicate our results and findings.

## TODO: Project 3
The given task was to implement a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch, including its backpropagation and a mini-batch gradient descent algorithm. Additionally, we were to develop a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch. Both models were trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. The accuracies and losses of training and validation splits were recorded during training. We compared both models and their performance.

A subsequent report was written to indicate our results and findings.
