# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and reports for the mini-projects done in McGill University's COMP551 course during Winter 2020.

## Project 1
The given task was to implement 2 classification models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in order to classify targets from 4 datasets acquired from UCI Machine Learning Repository. A subsequent report was written to indicate our results and findings.

## Project 2
The given task was to investigate 5 classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, and Random Forest. The 5 models were trained on two datasets: 20 newsgroup and IMDB Reviews.  A subsequent report was written to indicate our results and findings.
